UniStake 🦄
Seamlessly Integrating Uniswap v4 with EigenLayer for Automated Cross-Chain LST Staking

UniStake is a next-generation smart contract protocol that combines Uniswap v4 with EigenLayer to enable automated cross-chain deposits and staking of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs). By leveraging Uniswap v4 Hooks and Chainlink CCIP, UniStake provides a seamless and streamlined cross-chain staking experience.




### Architecture/Key Components

Key Components & Architecture

1. SwapAndRestakeEigenRouter




Core Responsibilities:





Manages Uniswap v4 swaps.
Facilitates direct deposits into EigenLayer strategies.
Enforces specific pool requirements for efficient operations.
Handles token-to-strategy mappings for dynamic staking.




2. UniStakeV1 Hook

Core Responsibilities:




Implements Uniswap v4 Hook interface for enhanced functionality.
Bridges tokens across chains via Chainlink CCIP.
Processes post-swap operations and handles bridge transactions.





### Key Features



1. Unified Swap & Stake





Single-transaction swaps and deposits.
Automatic integration with EigenLayer strategies.
Configurable deposit settings for enhanced flexibility.





2. Cross-Chain Capabilities





CCIP-powered token bridging for smooth cross-chain interactions.
Support for native and LINK fees for enhanced accessibility.
Secure and reliable message passing for multi-chain applications.




3. Flexible Strategy Management





Dynamic token-to-strategy mapping for adaptive staking.
Support for multiple Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).
Automated calculation of strategy shares for user convenience.


 
   



### User Flow

**Local Staking Flow**


1. User initiates swap with depositTokens: true

2. Swap executes through Uniswap v4

3. Output tokens automatically deposited into EigenLayer

4. User receives strategy shares






**Cross-Chain Staking Flow**


1. User initiates swap with isBridgeTx: true

2. Swap executes through Uniswap v4

3. Hook captures output tokens

4. Tokens bridged via CCIP to destination chain

5. User receives tokens on target chain




      






### Check Forge Installation
*Ensure that you have correctly installed Foundry (Forge) and that it's up to date. You can update Foundry by running:*

```
foundryup
```

## Set up

*requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)*

```
forge install
forge test
```

### Local Development (Anvil)

Other than writing unit tests (recommended!), you can only deploy & test hooks on [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/)

```bash
# start anvil, a local EVM chain
anvil

# in a new terminal
forge script script/Anvil.s.sol \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    --broadcast
```

See [script/](script/) for hook deployment, pool creation, liquidity provision, and swapping.

<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>



### *Permission Denied*

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) 

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook deployment failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
    * `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
    * `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
    * In **forge test**: the *deployer* for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
    * In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
        * If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`
